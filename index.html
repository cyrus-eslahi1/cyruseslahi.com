    <h3>My Backstory:</h3>
    <p>
      I've always loved coding and building things since I was 7. I've built drones, a cardboard soda dispenser (<i>It actually works!)</i> and I've done <a href="scratch.mit.edu/users/cyrus-dev">Scratch</a> for years but moved onto Python around 2 years ago. Last summer I started doing <a href="roblox.com/">Roblox</a> Game Development, and uploaded videos of it on TikTok and YouTube and got 350k views and 2.6k followers in total. I gained a big fanbase on my discord server, around 300 people in total and earned around $50 from selling game templates.</p>
    <p>At the time of writing this, im currently doing Computer Science as an elective in 8th grade. Im learning HTML and Javascript, and hopfully I learn CSS soon so I can make this website look better, as its only HTML. I will be updating this website as often as I can, and hopefully this website is still up at <a href="cyruseslahi.com"> cyruseslahi.com</a>
