        <p>This all starts in around <b>2019</b>. I was 7 years old, first learning about scratch. That absolutely changed my life. I began with doing small little tests and learning how coding really worked. Around a year later, I came back and start making actual games and animations. I recieved my first product of motivation, a Dash Robot. Its a robot that you can program to run around your house, and I loved that robot. I would use it almost every day, and it was my first peice of engineering.

            Around <b>2021</b>, me and my dad built a cardboard soda fountain that worked, and I really felt proud if that. Its still sititing in my dads office. (i will attach a photo when I get a chance) After this, i really loved coding and building things. My dad is an electricial engineer, so I learned a LOT from him. I also began to do coding classes with my friends, (their mom would teach us) but I was always finished way early and would even upgrade our lesson.

            Its around <b>2022-2023</b> and I began to take Python classes. I learned a lot, and purchased a lot of python books. I decided to start messing with Pygame and and actually made a finished working version of the popular game "Snake" and many more. It was fun, but I didin't really have the patience to sit and learn like I do know, all I  wanted to do was just make the game and play it in a short span, which I quickly learned wasen't possible.

            In <b>2024</b>, during school, I took a club, called FTC (first lego league), the goal of the club was to build & program a lego created robot to do tasks in a short amount of time. We had to try out, and thankfully, I made it in. I had multiple other friends in there and the first thing we build the robot. I built a robot alongside others, and when we were finally complete we chose 2 programmers, me and one of my closest friends at the time. He wasen't the best at coding, but he was very great compared to others. I had about 2-3 months to work on this, and I was often stressed due  to being the only person actually working on this project. Everybody else was playing games on the computers. After our preperation was done, we went to the competition, and got a score of around 800, which I don't remember if it was good or not. I never wanted to do that again, as I was stressed all the time because of being the only one working. But overall, good learning experience.

            <b>2025-2026</b>, I got back to programming on scratch, and made some debatably good games. Got tired of it though and eventually went to  8th grade, where I took the class "Fundamentals of Computer Science" I wasen't expecting it to be a good class overall, but rather thought it would be super easy. I was proven heavily wrong, as that class has thought me JavaScript, CSS, and HTML (still a beginner though) and I loved it.
